# daydream

The meat of the code for [Daydream](https://sathytrench.itch.io/daydream), a game built for a Wikipedia Game Jam in NYC in October 2025 by Akshita Jain, Gabe Fields, Jiadai He, and Anahit Gulian. We wanted to build something that allows players to experience the history of the world through dream-logic.

The code was written through conversations with ChatGPT and interacts directly with the Wikipedia API. I created this WebGL build without adding any new features, to preserve the game in its hackathon glory without leaving it so buggy it would discourage players.

Thank you to Char Stiles for the custom shader and to Wikipedia and Hex House for hosting the hackathon!
